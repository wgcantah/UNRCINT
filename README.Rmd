# UNRCINT

<!-- badges: start -->

This package is expected to help students in undertaking Unit Root Testing. \newline 
The package consist of two main functions:\newline

- **urootp** Conducts unit root test on the entire data frame and generates the test statistic with it's associated p-values 

- **urootc** Conducts unit root test on the entire data frame and generates the test statistic with it's associated critical values at 1%, 5% and 10% respectively. \newline

The package generate unit root test results based on:

- The **Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF)** Test 

- The **Phillips Perron (PP)** Test and 

- The **Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS)** test 



## Installation

You can install the development version of UNRCINT from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("wgcantah/UNRCINT")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(UNRCINT)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r data}
summary(data)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
urootp(data)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
